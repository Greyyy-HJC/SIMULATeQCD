The program in this folder will generate you a rational approximation file
for the use with the RHMC of the parallelgpucode

call with

rat_approx input.file > outfput.file

The input file should be structured like:

npff <- the # of pseudo-fermion flavors for which one need rat. approx.'s

#npff blocks like:

y1
y2
mprec
mq
order1
order2
lambda_low
lambda_high
precision

one block will generate three rat. approx.'s according to

f(x) = x^(y1/8)  (x+mprec^2-mq^2)^(y2/8)
g(x) = x^(-y1/8) (x+mprec^2-mq^2)^(-y2/8)
h(x) = x^(-y1/4) (x+mprec^2-mq^2)^(-y2/4)

with m^2 = mprec^2-mq^2

Example:  2+1f of fermions with std. Hasenbusch preconditioning for the light flavors

this will generate in general 6 rat. approx.'s 3

light:

f(x) = x^(1/4)  (x+ms^2-ml^2)^(-1/4)
g(x) = x^(-1/4) (x+ms^2-ml^2)^(1/4)
h(x) = x^(-1/2) (x+ms^2+ml^2)^(-1/2)

strange:

f(x) = x^(3/8)
g(x) = x^(-3/8)
h(x) = x^(-3/4)
